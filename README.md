# Foodle
  Nutrition App 
# Problem 
  Nutrition is one of the most important aspects of everyday life. In the 21st century, cardiovascular disease has become the most prevalent cause of death for Americans, and a big contributing factor of that has been the rising obesity rates caused by continued lack of information regarding nutrition and dieting. 
# Goals 
  - Target the key macronutrients: We calculate each user’s daily caloric, protein, and carbohydrate intake to make meal recommendations 
  - Inform users about food choices: The app takes in the user’s daily intake and returns recommendations for foods the user can consume to improve their diet. In doing so, we hope to be able to advise users not only what nutrients they need more of but also what types of foods can supply the lacking nutrients they need more of. 
  - Improve users’ dietary choices: Through displaying graphs and trends of the users’ diet over time, we aim to guide the user towards eating healthier through visualizing the process for them.  
# Process 
  - For our project, we utilized Figma to design the interface of our app. On the backend side, we utilized python to implement the app’s functions and cockroach labs to store our datasets.   
# Features 
  - Display Intake: Our app displays how many calories, grams of protein, carbs, and fats user consumes
  - Suggest food choices: Based on user’s input, suggest food choices to satisfy daily recommended values 
  - Present trends: Show trends in users’ intake of each macronutrient over time
